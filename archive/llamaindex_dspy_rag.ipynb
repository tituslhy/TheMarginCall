It assumes\\nthat past trading activity and price changes of a\\n[security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) can be valuable\\nindicators of the security\\'s future price movements when paired with\\nappropriate investing or trading rules.\\n\\nTechnical analysis\\' various charting tools are often used to generate short-\\nterm trading signals. They can also help improve the evaluation of a\\nsecurity\\'s strength or weakness relative to the broader market or one of its\\nsectors. This information helps analysts improve their overall valuation\\nestimate.\\n\\nTechnical analysis as we know it today was first introduced by [Charles\\nDow](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/10/pioneers-\\ntechnical-analysis.asp) as the Dow Theory in the late 1800s. Several\\nnoteworthy researchers including William P. Hamilton, Robert Rhea, Edson\\nGould, and John Magee further contributed to Dow Theory concepts. Nowadays,\\ntechnical analysis has evolved to include hundreds of patterns and signals\\ndeveloped through years of research.\\n\\n###  How Technical Analysis Is Used\\n\\nProfessional analysts often use technical analysis in conjunction with other\\nforms of research. Retail traders may make decisions based solely on the price\\ncharts of a security and similar statistics. But practicing equity analysts\\nrarely limit their research to fundamental or technical analysis alone.  \\n\\nTechnical analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading\\ndata. This includes stocks,\\n[futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp),\\n[commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), fixed-\\nincome securities, currencies, and more. In fact, technical analysis is\\nprevalent in commodities and\\n[forex](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp) markets where\\n[traders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daytrader.asp) focus on short-\\nterm price movements.  \\n\\nTechnical analysis attempts to forecast the price movement of virtually any\\ntradable instrument that is generally subject to forces of supply and demand.\\nSome view technical analysis as simply the supply and demand forces reflected\\nby the market price movements of a security.\\n\\nTechnical analysis most commonly applies to price changes, but some analysts\\ntrack numbers other than just price, such as trading volume or open interest\\nfigures.\\n\\n###  Technical Analysis Indicators\\n\\nHundreds of patterns and signals have been developed by researchers to support\\ntechnical analysis trading. Technical analysts have also developed numerous\\ntypes of trading systems to help them forecast and trade on price movements.\\n\\nSome indicators focus primarily on identifying the current market trend,\\nincluding support and resistance areas. Others focus on determining the\\nstrength of a trend and the likelihood of its continuation.\\n\\nCommonly used technical indicators and charting patterns include trendlines,\\nchannels, moving averages, and momentum indicators.\\n\\nIn general, technical analysts look at the following broad types of\\nindicators:\\n\\n  * Price trends\\n  * Chart patterns\\n  * Volume and [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/momentum-and-relative-strength-index/) indicators\\n  * [Oscillators](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oscillator.asp)\\n  * [Moving averages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/10/simple-exponential-moving-averages-compare.asp)\\n  * Support and resistance levels\\n\\n###\\n\\nThe CMT Association supports the largest collection of chartered or certified\\nanalysts using technical analysis professionally around the world. The\\nassociation\\'s Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation can be obtained\\nafter three levels of exams that cover both a broad and deep look at technical\\nanalysis tools.\\n\\n##  Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis\\n\\nTechnical analysis attempts to decipher the market sentiment behind price\\ntrends by looking for price patterns and trends.\\n\\nCharles Dow released a series of editorials discussing technical analysis\\ntheory. He had two basic assumptions that continue to form the framework for\\ntechnical analysis trading.\\n\\nThe\\nassociation\\'s Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation can be obtained\\nafter three levels of exams that cover both a broad and deep look at technical\\nanalysis tools.\\n\\n##  Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis\\n\\nTechnical analysis attempts to decipher the market sentiment behind price\\ntrends by looking for price patterns and trends.\\n\\nCharles Dow released a series of editorials discussing technical analysis\\ntheory. He had two basic assumptions that continue to form the framework for\\ntechnical analysis trading.\\n\\n  * Markets are efficient with values that represent factors that influence a security\\'s price.\\n  * Even random market price movements appear to move in identifiable patterns and trends that tend to repeat over time.\\n\\nToday the field of technical analysis builds on Dow\\'s work. Professional\\nanalysts typically accept three general assumptions:\\n\\n  1. **The market discounts everything:** Technical analysts believe that everything from a company\\'s fundamentals to broad market factors to [market psychology](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketpsychology.asp) is already priced into a stock. The [Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp) draws a similar conclusion about prices. The only thing remaining is the analysis of price movements, which technical analysts view as the product of supply and demand for a particular stock.\\n  2. **Price moves in trends:** Technical analysts expect that prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. In other words, a stock price is more likely to continue a past trend than to move erratically. Most technical trading strategies are based on this assumption.\\n  3. **History tends to repeat itself:** The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable and based on emotions such as fear and excitement. Technical analysis uses chart patterns to analyze these emotions and subsequent price movements to understand trends. While many forms of technical analysis have been used for more than 100 years, they are believed to be relevant still because they illustrate patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves.\\n\\n##  Fundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis\\n\\nFundamental analysis and technical analysis, the major schools of thought when\\nit comes to approaching the markets, are at opposite ends of the spectrum.\\nBoth methods are used to research and [forecast future trends in stock\\nprices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analysis-of-stocks-and-\\ntrends.asp), and like any investment strategy or philosophy, both have their\\nadvocates and adversaries.\\n\\n###  Fundamental Analysis\\n\\nFundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to\\nmeasure the [intrinsic\\nvalue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp) of a stock.\\nFundamental analysts study everything from the overall economy and industry\\nconditions to the financial condition and management of companies.\\n[Earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp),\\n[expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp), assets, and\\nliabilities are all important characteristics of fundamental analysis that\\nhelp analysts determine the fair value of a business.\\n\\n###  Technical Analysis\\n\\nTechnical analysis differs from fundamental analysis in that the stock\\'s price\\nand volume are the only inputs. The core assumption is that all publicly known\\nfundamentals have factored into price; thus, there is no need to pay close\\nattention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security\\'s\\nintrinsic value, but instead, [use stock charts to identify\\npatterns](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/mcginley-dynamic-\\nindicator.asp) and trends that suggest how a stock\\'s price will move in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n##  Limitations of Technical Analysis\\n\\n**1.** For some analysts and academic researchers, the EMH demonstrates why no\\nactionable information is contained in [historical\\nprice](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historic-pricing.asp) and volume\\ndata. However, by the same reasoning, nor should business fundamentals provide\\nactionable information. These points of view are known as the weak form and\\nsemi-strong form of the EMH.\\n\\n**2.** Another criticism of technical analysis is that history does not repeat\\nitself exactly, so price pattern study is of dubious importance and can be\\nignored. Prices seem to be better modeled as a random walk.\\n\\n**3.** A third criticism of technical analysis is that it works in some cases\\nbut only because it constitutes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, many\\ntechnical traders will place a [stop-loss\\norder](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) below the\\n200-day moving average of a certain company.\\n\\n[more](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-analysis.asp)\\n\\n[Fundamental Analysis: Principles, Types, and How to Use\\nIt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp)\\n\\nFundamental analysis is a method of measuring a stock\\'s intrinsic value.\\nAnalysts who follow this method try to find under- or overvalued stocks.\\n\\n[more](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp)\\n\\n[Swing Trading: Definition and the Pros and Cons for\\nInvestors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swingtrading.asp)\\n\\nSwing trading is an attempt to capture gains in an asset over a few days to\\nseveral weeks.

Options require paying a premium upfront and have limited downside risk for buyers, while futures have lower initial costs but potentially unlimited risk. Options are more flexible in how they can be settled, while futures contracts must be fulfilled or offset at expiration.

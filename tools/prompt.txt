Context Str: ### Options Because they tend to be fairly complex, options contracts tend to be risky. Call and put options can be equally risky. When an investor buys a stock option, its risk is defined by its cost or premium. In the worst-case scenario, the option premium spent will be a total loss if the options expire worthless. However, selling a put option exposes the seller to a loss potentially much larger than the premium gained from a possible decline in the value of the shares underlying the stock option. If a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the [stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) at $50 per share but the stock falls to $10, the seller remains on the hook to purchase the stock at $50 per share. The risk to the buyer of an option is limited to the premium paid upfront. An option's price fluctuates based on a number of factors, including how far the [strike price is from the underlying](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/when-put-option- considered-be-money.asp) security's current price, as well as the time remaining before expiration. This premium is paid to the seller of the put option, also called the [option writer](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/091714/basics- options-profitability.asp). ### The Option Writer The option writer is on the other side of the trade. Option sellers take on more risk relative to option buyers. Since there is no upper bound to a share price, there is no upper limit to how much the seller of a call option can lose on the rise in the share price. Option sellers may own the underlying stock to limit their risk. The option buyer as well as the option seller may trade out of the position in the options market. ### Futures Options may be risky, but [futures can be riskier](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/money_management_futures.asp) still for the individual investor. Futures contracts obligate both the buyer and the seller. Futures positions are [marked to market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marktomarket.asp) daily, and, as the underlying instrument's price moves, the buyer or seller may have to provide additional margin. ### Futures contracts require a significant capital commitment. The obligation to sell or buy at a given price makes futures riskier by their nature. ## Examples of Options and Futures ### Options To complicate matters, options are bought and sold on futures. But that allows for an illustration of the differences between options and futures. In this example, one options contract for gold on the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp) (CME) has as its underlying asset one COMEX gold futures contract. An [options investor](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/06/options4advantages.asp) could have purchased a call option for a premium of $2.60 per contract with a strike price of $1,600 expiring in February 2019. The holder of this call would have had a bullish view on gold and held the right to assume the underlying gold futures position until the option expiration after the market close on February 22, 2019. If the price of gold rose above the strike price of $1,600, the investor would have exercised the right to buy the futures contract. Otherwise, the investor would have allowed the options contract to expire. Their maximum loss was the $2.60 premium paid for the contract. ### Futures The investor might have purchased a futures contract on gold instead. One futures contract has as its underlying asset 100 troy ounces of gold. This means the buyer is obligated to accept 100 [troy ounces](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/troyounce.asp) of gold from the seller on the delivery date specified in the futures contract. Assuming the trader has no interest in actually owning the gold, the contract will be sold before the [delivery date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deliverydate.asp) or rolled over to a new futures contract. The put buyer may also choose to exercise the right to sell at the strike price. ## Futures A [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp) contract is the obligation to sell or buy an asset [at a later date](https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-trade-futures-5214571) at an agreed- upon price. Futures contracts are a true hedge investment and are most understandable when considered in terms of [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp) like corn or oil. For instance, a farmer may want to lock in an acceptable crop price in case market prices fall before the crop can be delivered. The buyer also wants to lock in a price to protect against a subsequent rise in prices. ### Examples Let's demonstrate with an example. Assume two [traders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) agree to a $7 per bushel price on a corn futures contract. If the price of corn moves up to $9, the buyer of the contract makes $2 per bushel. The seller, on the other hand, loses out on a better deal. The market for futures has expanded greatly beyond oil and corn. Futures can be purchased on an index like the [S&P 500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp), and on individual stocks in some jurisdictions. (Single-stock futures have not been available in the U.S. since 2020.) Buyers of a futures contract are not required to pay the full value of the contract up front. Instead, they cover a percentage of the price as an [initial margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initialmargin.asp). For example, an oil futures contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil. An agreement to buy an oil futures contract at $100 requires the buyer to risk $100,000. The buyer may be required to pay several thousand dollars up front, and may be required to increase that commitment later if oil prices subsequently drop. ### Futures markets primarily serve [institutional investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp). These may include refiners seeking to hedge crude costs or cattle producers seeking to lock in feed prices. ### Who Trades Futures? Futures markets serve commodity producers, commodity consumers, and speculators. Futures contracts can protect buyers as well as sellers from wide price [swings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swing.asp) in the underlying commodity. They also cater to institutional as well as retail traders seeking to profit from expected changes in market prices for the [underlying security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp) or commodity. Financial speculators typically don't intend to acquire the underlying commodity when the contract is settled, and are likely to sell their position beforehand. ### Futures trading hours may differ from stock and options markets. Normal trading hours are often 8:30a.m.–3:00p.m., with electronic trading on the CME's [Globex](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globex.asp) platform overnight from 5:00p.m.–8:30a.m. CT. Some futures products trade 24-hours a day on Globex. ## Key Differences Aside from the differences noted above, there are other things that set options and futures apart. Here are some other major differences between these two financial instruments. ### Options Because they tend to be fairly complex, options contracts tend to be risky. Call and put options can be equally risky. When an investor buys a stock option, its risk is defined by its cost or premium. In the worst-case scenario, the option premium spent will be a total loss if the options expire worthless. However, selling a put option exposes the seller to a loss potentially much larger than the premium gained from a possible decline in the value of the shares underlying the stock option. If a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the [stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) at $50 per share but the stock falls to $10, the seller remains on the hook to purchase the stock at $50 per share. The risk to the buyer of an option is limited to the premium paid upfront.
Query Str: What is the difference between an option and a future?
Answer: The key differences between options and futures are: 1. Risk profile: Options have limited downside risk for the buyer (limited to the premium paid), but unlimited upside risk for the seller. Futures have unlimited risk for both the buyer and seller. 2. Obligation: Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset. Futures create an obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at the agreed-upon price on the expiration date. 3. Pricing: Option prices fluctuate based on factors like the underlying asset's price, time to expiration, and volatility. Futures prices are determined by the current and expected future spot price of the underlying asset. 4. Settlement: Options can be exercised to take delivery of the underlying asset or settled in cash. Futures contracts typically result in the actual delivery of the underlying asset, unless the position is closed out prior to expiration. 5. Participants: Options markets tend to have more individual/retail traders, while futures markets are dominated by institutional investors and commercial hedgers. In summary, options provide more flexibility and limited risk, while futures create a binding obligation to transact the underlying asset at a predetermined price and date.

Query Str: What are the similarities between an option and a future?
Answer: Here are the key similarities between options and futures: 1. Both options and futures contracts involve an agreement to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. 2. Both allow traders to speculate on the future price movements of the underlying asset, whether it's a commodity, stock, bond, or other financial instrument. 3. Both require an initial margin or premium payment upfront, rather than the full value of the contract. 4. Both can be used by traders and investors to hedge their positions and manage risk. 5. Both derive their value from the underlying asset, and their prices fluctuate based on factors like time to expiration, volatility, and the difference between the strike price and current market price. So in summary, while options and futures have some key differences, they are both derivative instruments that allow traders to gain exposure to an underlying asset and profit

Context Str: ![A computer screen close up showing colorful charts for an investment porfolio, while an out of focus hand in the foreground holds paperwork](https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/eYaPVpoN- RCM9i5UAipi4o7nJCo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale\(\):max_bytes\(150000\):strip_icc\(\)/GettyImages-592232681-0bedb3d0696b45df845dc5f05a1843c9.jpg) Rafe Swan / Getty Images ## Options [Options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) are based on the value of an underlying stock, index future, or commodity. An options contract gives an investor the right to buy or sell the underlying instrument at a specific price while the contract is in effect. Investors may choose not to [exercise](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp) their options. Options are financial derivatives. Option holders do not own the underlying shares or enjoy shareholder rights unless they exercise an option to buy stock. Options contracts for stocks typically provide the right to buy or sell 100 shares of the stock at the specified [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) before the contract expiration date, and the price of the option is known as its [premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp). ### In the U.S., the equity options market is open from 9:30am - 4:00pm EST; the same as normal stock trading hours. Options exchanges are also closed on holidays when stock exchanges are closed. ### Types of Options: Call and Put Options There are only two kinds of options: [Call options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) and [put options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp). A call option confers the right to buy a stock at the strike price before the agreement expires. A put option gives the holder the right to sell a stock at a specific price. Let's look at an example of each—first of a call option. An investor buys a call option to buy stock XYZ at a $50 [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021014/options- basics-how-pick-right-strike-price.asp) sometime within the next three months. The stock is currently trading at $49. If the stock jumps to $60, the call buyer can exercise the right to buy the stock at $50. That buyer can then immediately sell the stock for $60 for a $10 profit per share. ### Other Possibilities Alternatively, the option buyer can simply sell the call and pocket the [profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp), since the call option is worth $10 per share. If the option is trading below $50 at the time the contract expires, the option is worthless. The call buyer loses the upfront payment for the option, called the premium. Meanwhile, if an investor owns a put option to sell XYZ at $100, and XYZ’s price falls to $80 before the option expires, the investor will gain $20 per share, minus the cost of the premium. If the price of XYZ is above $100 at [expiration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp), the option is worthless and the investor loses the premium paid upfront. Either the put buyer or the writer can close out their option position to lock in a profit or loss at any time before its expiration. This is done by buying the option, in the case of the writer, or selling the option, in the case of the buyer. The put buyer may also choose to exercise the right to sell at the strike price. ## Futures A [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp) contract is the obligation to sell or buy an asset [at a later date](https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-trade-futures-5214571) at an agreed- upon price. Futures contracts are a true hedge investment and are most understandable when considered in terms of [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp) like corn or oil.

Context Str: Think of this as a first date. You probably wouldn't go on a date with somebody if you had no idea who they were. If you do, you're asking for trouble. This information is very easy to find. Using the search engine of your choice, go to the company website and read about them. Then, go to a family member and educate them on your potential investment. If you can answer all of their questions, you know enough. ## 2\. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio Imagine for a moment you were in the market for somebody who could help you with your investments. You interview two financial advisors. One has a long history of making people a lot of money. Your friends have seen a big return from this financial advisor, and you can't find any reason why you shouldn't trust them with your investment dollars. They tell you that for every dollar they make for you, they are going to keep 40 cents, leaving you with 60 cents. The other financial advisor is just getting started in the business. They have very little experience and, although they seem promising, they don't have much of a track record of success. The advantage of investing your money with this financial advisor is that they are cheaper. They only want to keep 20 cents for every dollar they make you. But what if they don't make you as many dollars as the first financial advisor? ### You can calculate the P/E ratio by dividing a company's market value per share by its earnings per share. If you understand this example, you understand the [price-to- earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) (P/E) ratio. These ratios are used to measure a company's current share price relative to its per-share earnings. The company can be compared to other, similar corporations so that analysts and investors can determine its [relative value](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental- analysis/09/elements-stock-value.asp). So if a company has a P/E ratio of 20, this means investors are willing to pay $20 for every $1 per earnings. That might seem expensive but not if the company is growing fast. The [P/E can be found](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental- analysis/09/price-to-earnings-and-growth-ratios.asp) by comparing the current [market price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp) to the cumulative earnings of the last four quarters. Compare this number to other companies similar to the one you're researching. If your company has a higher P/E than other similar companies, there had better be a reason. If it has a lower P/E but is growing fast, that's an investment worth watching. ## 3\. Beta [Beta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) seems like something difficult to understand, but it's not. It measures [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp), or how moody your company's stock has acted over the last five years. In essence, it measures the systemic risk involved with a company's stock compared to that of the entire market. You can usually find the beta value on the same page as the P/E ratio when reviewing stock research pages such as those found at Yahoo or Google. Think of the S&P 500 as the pillar of mental stability. If your company drops or rises in value more than the index over a five-year period, it has a higher beta. With beta, anything higher than one is high—[meaning higher risk](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-know-risk/)—and anything lower than one is low beta or lower risk. Beta says something about [price risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricerisk.asp), but how much does it say about fundamental risk factors? You have to watch high beta stocks closely because, although they have the potential to make you a lot of money, they also have the potential to take your money. A lower beta means that a stock doesn't react to the S&P 500 movements as much as others. This is known as a [defensive stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defensivestock.asp) because your money is much safer. You won't make as much in a short amount of time, but you also don't have to watch it every day. ## 4\. ### Non-Current Assets and Liabilities Non-current assets or liabilities are those with lives expected to extend beyond the next year. For a company like The Outlet, its biggest non-current asset is likely to be the [property, plant, and equipment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppe.asp) the company needs to run its business. [Long-term liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermliabilities.asp) might be related to obligations under property, plant, and equipment leasing contracts, along with other borrowings. ### Financial Position: Book Value If we subtract [total liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/total- liabilities.asp) from assets, we are left with shareholder equity. Essentially, this is the [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp), or accounting value, of the shareholders' stake in the company. It is principally made up of the capital contributed by shareholders over time and profits earned and retained by the company, including that portion of any profit not paid to shareholders as a [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp). ### Market-to-Book Multiple By comparing the company's market value to its book value, investors can, in part, determine whether a stock is under- or over-priced. The market-to-book multiple, while it does have shortcomings, remains a [crucial tool for value investors](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/book- value-basics.asp). Extensive academic evidence shows that companies with low market-to-book stocks perform better than those with high multiples.

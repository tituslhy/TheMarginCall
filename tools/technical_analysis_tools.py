        Super function to conduct technical analysis on a particular stock ticker.
        The analysis methods are:
        1. Accumulation/Distribution Index ("adi"): A trend metric of stock price and volume
        2. Aroon Indicator: Measures whether securities are in trend and if a new trend is beginning
        3. Bollinger Bands: An indication of stock price volatility and momentum by determining where 
        prices are relative to each other.
        4. Ichimoku indicator: Measures whether price and averaged average price trends are coherent
        5. Moving average convergence divergence ("macd"): Ascertains trend direction and momentum
        6. Stochastic Oscillator ("stoch"): Measures the current price relative to the price range over
        a number of periods
        7. Stochastic Relative Strength Index ("stochrsi"): A 2nd derivative trend indicator of price
        focusing on market momentum. This index is more sensitive than the relative

    "    2. Net Margin (%): The ratio of net proft / total income. This informs on whether the company\n",

    "    3. Current Ratio: The ratio of current assets/current liabilities. This informs on whether\n",
    "    the company has more assets on hand than liabilities on hand.\n",
    "    4. Quick Ratio: The ratio of current assets less inventory / current liabilities. This gives a\n",
    "    more in-depth picture on whether the company has more assets than liabilities on hand.\n",
    "    5. Return on Assets (%): Ratio of net income /total assets. Shows how much profit a company is\n",

    "    8. Debt to equity (%): Ratio of a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity. If the\n",

    "    9. P/E ratio: Ratio of share price to earnings per share. Provides an indication to whether a\n",
